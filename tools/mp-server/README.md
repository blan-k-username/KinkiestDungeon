# tools/mp-server — Multiplayer server PoC (KD-079)

A **lightweight, throwaway** proof that the server-authoritative MP architecture
(epic KD-078 / KD-066) works end-to-end: the stock game bundle runs headless in
plain Node, and one *world* instance + two *player* instances step in lockstep
over one shared scenario, kept consistent each turn.

This is PoC-tier. Production hardening lives in KD-067 (host), KD-068 (serverMode),
KD-069 (orchestrator), KD-070 (reconciler).

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `shims.js` | Headless shim layer — PIXI/DOM/WebGL/Audio/IndexedDB/`fetch` stubs so `out/main.js` boots with no browser. `fetch` is file-backed (local reads only). |
| `headless-host.js` | `HeadlessHost` — boots the bundle in an **isolated `vm.Context` per instance** and bridges into its script scope via an appended `__KDEVAL`. Exposes `init/step/getState/eval` + scenario & reconciler helpers. |
| `orchestrator.js` | `Orchestrator` — 1 world + 2 player hosts, global turn clock (`submitMove`), and the minimal reconciler. |
| `smoke-boot.js` | Manual one-instance smoke driver (boot → init → step). |

## How it works

- **Isolation:** each instance gets its own V8 context, so every KD `let`/`const`
  global (e.g. `KinkyDungeonCurrentTick`) is private. This is what allows three
  live instances in one Node process.
- **Bridge:** KD globals are top-level `let` (script scope, not on the global
  object). `__KDEVAL` is appended to the same script as the bundle so its closure
  can read/write them — the Node analogue of Playwright's `page.evaluate`.
- **No source edits:** rendering is neutered and `serverMode` is implemented by
  reassigning KD's globals at runtime (`DrawCharacter`, `KinkyDungeonUpdateEnemies`)
  — the same reassignable-global mechanism the mod system uses.

## Run

All commands run **inside Docker** (per project rules — no host runtimes).

```bash
# Manual smoke (one instance)
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app node:23-slim \
  node -e "setTimeout(()=>process.exit(2),120000).unref(); require('./tools/mp-server/smoke-boot.js')"

# Automated tests (node-layer Vitest, no Chromium)
tools/run-tests.sh unit     # includes tests/unit/mp-headless-host.spec.ts + mp-orchestrator.spec.ts
```

> Build `out/main.js` first with `npx tsc` in Docker (NOT `npm run build` — no
> python in the image). `run-tests.sh` does this for you.

## Known limitations (PoC)

- Full `KinkyDungeonGenerateSaveData()` is **not** supported headless — the save
  path reads model `Poses` produced by the (neutered) draw pipeline. Full
  save/load round-trip is production host scope (KD-067).
- The shim layer tracks the bundle's PIXI/DOM surface as of this build; it must be
  updated as the game's rendering surface changes.
